                <h2>Our Thropy and Reward since 2023</h2>
                <p>Mercedes finished the 2022 season third in the Constructors' Championship with the one win at SÃ£o Paulo marking their best result of the season. 
                    Russell finished 4th in the Drivers' Championship having scored the win in Brazil plus a pole position in Hungary. 
                    Hamilton finished 6th in the Drivers' Championship marking the first time in his career he finished outside the top 5, 
                    with 2022 also marking the first time Hamilton had failed to score a pole position or Grand Prix win during a season.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> After continuing to struggle with their radical "zero-pods" design in the 2023 season. Mercedes opted to replace Technical Director Mike Elliott with James Allison, with Elliott becoming Chief Technical Officer. 
                    This change occurred on 21 April 2023.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mercedes finished 2023 second in the Constructors' Championship, 3 points ahead of Ferrari.
                    The season however still was disappointing as the team failed to secure a win for the first time since 2011. 
                    The closest the team came to winning was at the United States Grand Prix where Hamilton finished 0.3 seconds 
                    behind World Champion Max Verstappen before he was disqualified for his rear skid blocks being worn below the limit. 
                    Hamilton finished 2023 third in the Drivers' Championship with 6 podiums, 
                    with the highlight of his season being breaking the record for the most pole positions at a single circuit 
                    after he took his 9th pole at the Hungaroring during the Hungarian Grand Prix. Russell had a miserable season finishing 8th 
                    in the Drivers' Championship with 2 podiums.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The team admitted the W15 will have a completely different concept for the 2024 season with their intentions to be trying to catch up 
                    to pace setters Red Bull for their hope of claiming the championship or fighting for wins.</p>
